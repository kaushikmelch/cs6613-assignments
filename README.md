# cs6613-assignments (Aritificial Intelligence)

This repository contains the assignments for the AI course cs6613

Assignment 1
Stochastic Gradient Descent from Scratch

Assignment 2: 
1. Video/Frame Preprocessing
2. Object Detection using COCO trained Faster RCNN
3. Train a convolutional autoencoder with customised COCO dataset that has classes detected in step 2
4. Extract embeddings for the frames detected in Step 2
5. Index embeddings in PostgreSQL
6. Search PostgreSQL with image queries returns first 10 similar images

Assignment 3:
1. Preprocess videos
2. Object detection using YOLOv8(pretrained on Visdrone dataset)
3. Predict next state of the detected objects using Kalman filter

Midterm Take Home:
1. Plot the training process on information plane similar to https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00810
2. CNN Classifier to classify CIFAR10 dataset and plot training on information plane similar to Step 1
